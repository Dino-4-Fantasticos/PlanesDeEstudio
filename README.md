## User description

Web page that includes the classes of various ITESM study models (ITC11 and ARQ11 ATM). It allows you to mark subjects with different colors to visualize the ones you have already taken, the ones you are currently taking and the ones you are planning to take.

## Technical description

HTML and CSS is used for the frontend. Some bootstrap elements are also included.

Javascript is used for the modification of tables and changes in the progress bar.

JSON is used to have the information of the courses, as well as their semester and the requirements to register it. We use HTTP requests to access the JSON files, so to run locally the app you'll need to set up a local server.

## Current status of the project
