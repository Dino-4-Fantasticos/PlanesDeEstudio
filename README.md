### User description

Web page that includes the classes of the ITESM study model for software engineering (ITC11). It allows you to mark subjects with different colors to visualize the ones you have already taken, the ones you are currently taking and the ones you are planning to take.

### Technical description

HTML and CSS is used for the frontend. Some bootstrap elements are also included. 

Javascript is used for the modification of tables and changes in the progress bar. 

JSON is used to have the information of the courses, as well as their semester and the requirements to register it.

### Current status of the project
In constant development
- Course selection: *DONE!*
- Semester selection: *DONE!*
- Progress bar: *DONE!*
- Automatic tables: *IN PROGRESS...*

### What's next?

We are currently working on having the tables generated automatically with a JSON file. Once we achieve this, it will be possible to load one JSON file per carrer to create the corresponding table.
